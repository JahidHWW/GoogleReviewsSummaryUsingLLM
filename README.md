# GoogleReviewsSummaryUsingLLM
In this project, I used python and PaLM2 to output a summary of google reviews of any establishment.

Steps to run project locally:
Get PaLM2 API Key from Google AI.
In config.py, paste the key (Do not share publicly).
Install packages and libraries from requirements.
